By Fate's Design is a roguelike game created in Python using the pygame library.

Inspiration for the game was drawn from a deck of tarot cards, and implemented accordingly in the design of the enemies, as well as the ever increasing challenge presented throughout.

The game can be run through the main.py file. Inside the resources/audio folder, the music track "Obliteration.wav" by Kevin MacLeod is missing, due to its large size (greater than 25mb).
